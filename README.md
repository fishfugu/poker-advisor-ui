# Poker Advisor UI

A Unity-based interface for entering and visualising Texas Hold’em poker games, designed to analyse the current state of play and provide strategic feedback. Built in C# using Unity, this project is part of a collaborative game development project.

## Features (Planned)

- Input your hand, community cards, and opponents' actions
- View a clear visualisation of the current game state
- Get feedback or advice on your next move (fold, call, raise, etc.)
- Designed for Texas Hold’em, with future flexibility for other poker variants

## Tech Stack

- **Unity (2D project)**
- **C#**
- GitHub Codespaces (for collaborative development)

## Project Goals

This project is part of a personal initiative to:

* Learn more about C# and Unity
