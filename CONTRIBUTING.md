# Contributing to Poker Advisor UI

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

This is a fun, family-driven Unity project focused on visualising and evaluating poker hands, particularly Texas Holdâ€™em. The goal is to learn together and build something useful (and possibly extendable to real strategy logic later).

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repo and clone your copy.
2. Open the project in **Unity Hub**.
3. Make sure you're using the correct Unity version (2022.x LTS recommended - but check the last time this tfile was updatedf before trusting that reference!)
4. Explore the scene and scripts in `/Assets/` (qgain, make sure I updated this fiule recently... at the time of writing, nothing is certain)
5. Use a feature branch and submit a pull request.

## Code Guidelines

- Scripts go in `/Assets/Scripts/` (see above about "nothing certain")
- Prefer **descriptive naming** (e.g. `CardInputHandler.cs`)
- Keep classes small and focused
- Use Unity best practices (Update loops, event-driven UI, etc.)

## Good First Tasks

- Improve the card entry interface
- Add tooltips or labels to buttons
- Improve visual layout using Unity's UI system
- Build a card data structure or visual prefab
- Ping me if this list looks totally out of date!

## Commit Style

Use clear commit messages:
```
feat: added basic card input
fix: corrected card rank display bug
refactor: moved card logic to separate script
```


## Communication

If you're collaborating (especially family/friends):
- Use GitHub issues or TODOs in commits to track work
- Discuss big changes before implementing
